## What is Data Warehouse ?
---
- <b> What is Data Warehouse  ?</b>
    - A transaction symbolizes unit of work performed within a database management system
    - eg. reads and writes

| Database | Data warehouse |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) | Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) |
| A database was built to store current transactions and enable fast access to specific transactions for ongoing business processes | A data warehouse is built to store large quantities of historical data and enable fast, complex queries across all the data |
| Adding Items to your Shopping List | Generating Reports |
| Single Source | Multiple Source |
| Short transactions (small and simple queries ) with an emphasis on writes. | Long transactions (long and complex queries ) with an emphasis on reads |

## Introduction to Redshift
---
- AWS Redshift is the AWS managed, petabyte-scale solution for <ins> Data Warehousing </ins>
- Pricing starts at just <ins> $0.25 per hour </ins> with no upfront costs or commitments. 
- Scale up to petabytes for $1000 per terabyte , per year
- Redshift price is less than 1/10 cost of most similar services 
- Redshift is used for Business Intelligence
- Redshift uses <ins> OLAP (Online Analytics Processing System)</ins>
- Redshift is <b> <ins> Columnar Storage Database  </ins> </b>
- Columnar Storage for database tables is an important factor in optimizing analytic query performance because it <ins> drastically reduces the overall disk I/O requirements </ins> and reduces the amount of data you need to load from disk

## Redshift Use Case
---

- We want to continuously COPY data from 
    1. EMR
    2. S3 and
    3. DynamoDB
    - to power a customer Business Intelligence tool
- Using a third-party library we can connect and query Redshift for data.

## Redshift Columnar Storage
---
- Columnar Storage stores data together as columns instead of rows

    <img src="../images/RedShift/columnar-storage.jpg" width="47%"/>

- OLAP applications look at multiple records at the same time. You save memory because you fetch just the columns of data you need instead of whole rows
- Since data is stored via column, that means all data is of the same data-type allowing for easy compression
