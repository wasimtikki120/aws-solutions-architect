- A fully managed service to extract, transform and load (ETL) your data for analytics
- Discover and search across different AWS data sets without moving your data
- AWS Glue retrieves data from sources and writes data to targets stored and transported in various data formats
    - If your data is stored or transported in Parquet data format, this document introduces you available features for using your data in AWS Glue
- AWS glue consists of 
    - Central metadata repository
    - ETL engine
    - Flexible scheduler
- Use Cases:
    - Run queries against an Amazon S3 data lake 
        - You can use AWS Glue to make your data available for analytics without moving your data 
    - Analyze the log data in your data warehouse
        - Create ETL transcripts to transform, flatten and enrich the data from source to target

- Integration with AWS Glue 
    - To create database and table schema in the AWS Glue Data Catalog, you can run an AWS Glue crawler from within Athena on a data source, or you can run Data Definition Language (DDL) queries directly in the Athena Query Editor. 
    - Then, using the database and table schema that you created, you can use Data Manipulation (DML) queries in Athena to query the data.
- Set up AWS Glue Crawlers using S3 event notifications
